    <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. It promotes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, allowing for more modular and reusable code.<br>

        Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a visual language used to represent and communicate the design of object-oriented systems. It uses diagrams to illustrate classes, relationships, and interactions, helping developers plan and understand software systems.</p>
